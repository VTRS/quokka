In this category the key components that will be tackled are the interventions. Interventions refer to the methods or interactions implemented in the application to handle directly the issue of the user. Some recommended techniques to do so with software are . Psychoeducation . Knowledge is a simple yet helpful to impenitent in a MH application. To do this right there are two important characteristics that should be part of the solution; reliable information and easy intuitive access to data. . Therapeutic Treatment . According to the insight gathered from the interviews, the treatment must be done supervised by a professional therapist, therefore if it is desired functionality of the given application, a psychologist must be part of the development and monitoring team. There are some techniques like cognitive behavioral therapy and mindfulness that have been proven methods that can be implemented mostly automated, but it is consider a better idea to combine them with regular therapy to ensure good results. . Professional Help . Every single MH application should have an easy access to professional help, this could go from live chatting for questions to suicide hotlines for the worst case scenarios. It is important that this is considered from the begging of the design because this apps will be dealing with complex personal problems and it is important to provide all necessary tools to ensure the user’s safety. .",

For any kind of software application related to mental health, it is highly recommended if not a must, that a professional of the area; being a psychologist, therapist, psychiatrist or related, is involved not just during the design process of the application, but alongside it’s usage. Since the application is intended to be used to solve delicate issues, and it is going to be dealing with human beings, it is important that people with certain level of knowledge in the area participate monitoring and intervening the it is necessary. Also for certain use cases, it is recommended that the functionality is implemented as a tool to help with regular therapy and not as a substitute. The amount of professionals and the time they will intervene in the application might be defined by each team according to the specific functionalities implemented in the application. . Developer . To have a reliable software solution the constant involvement of the development team must be assured. Their role is to preserve the integrity of the application and improve the experience of the users. The decisions regarding the implementation of any new forms of interventions should always be done side by side with the professionals involved in the project to ensure the proper implementation of any idea. . Patient/User . The final user is the real key of the system, the application must ensure their security and aim to be a helpful resource to achieve which ever the goal of the application may be. Users must have easy access to information regarding the evidence backing up the implemented functionalities of the application. In addition, they must have the power to control their privacy setting, such as if they want their data to be used for research or which information may a professional be able to see. User engagement is an important topic and intrusive ways to get it must be avoided. It is recommended to ensure future interactions by the implementation of goal settings and scheduled interventions or monitoring questionaries. .",
